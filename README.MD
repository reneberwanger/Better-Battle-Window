# Better Battle Window V2

**Better Battle Window** is a visually enhanced modification of the [Big Battle View](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3030427202) mod by the talented creator **Agami**. This mod focuses on improving the visual aspects of the battle interface in Crusader Kings III, bringing a more immersive and detailed fullscreen battle view experience.

# About the Mod

This mod builds on the foundation laid by **Big Battle View**, adding purely visual enhancements to elevate the battle experience:

- Retains the detailed fullscreen battle view that Big Battle View introduced.
- Switch between views using the new button on the bottom of the battle view or on top of fullscreen mode.
- Compact view and expanded view with army buffs and debuffs.
- Displays large knight portraits when there are fewer than 3 Men-at-Arms.
- Map view mode: (click on terrain icon or on eye icon at the bottom of the screen).
- Lots of info on tooltips, hover your mouse and see why you might be losing battles.

In addition to these features, **Better Battle Window V2** is designed to work seamlessly with my other mods, [Better Terrain Graphics 4K](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3305519391) and [Ultimate Map Graphics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3293659496). When used together, these mods provide a cohesive and visually stunning gameplay experience, especially during battles.
